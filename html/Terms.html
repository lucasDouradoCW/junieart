        <p>Important Information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your commission may take a week or two at most to be done. If you want it faster, I will charge more (15%) for a faster delivery!</li>
            <li>I will require reference pictures of the pet you want a portrait of. More pictures are better, so I can represent your pet well!</li>
            <li>For pet portraits, I am able to write a name and/or phrase on the page. Please let me know if and what you'd like asap! Examples <a href="petportraitrefs.html">here</a>.</li>
            <li>Also for pet portraits, I can use tinted or white paper. You can let me know if you have a preference or if I should decide! All colours can be seen <a href="petportraitrefs.html">here</a>.</li>
            <li>For characters, reference images are very much appreciated but not necessary. Without a reference, however, I will ask for extra (20%)! </li>
            <li>If you don't have a reference for a character, please include as much information as possible.</li>
            <li>Payment will be done through PayPal. I will send you the sketch, and will continue drawing after the full payment is sent.</li>
            <li>I am currently in southern Ontario. For physical art, if you want the physical version, I am happy to send it to you! I will ask for enough to cover shipping, and will package the piece up safely to ship! I will also send you a scanned copy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you agree to all these, go ahead and contact me <a href="ContactMe.html">here!</a></p>
