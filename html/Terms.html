            <li>Real people (with their consent)</li>
            <li>Ship art (hugging, kissing, etc)</li>
            <li>Pets of any kind - dogs, cats, horses, fish, birds, lizards, and anything else!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Things I won't draw (May change):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>NSFW art</li>
            <li>Pet portraits WITHOUT reference images provided</li>
            <li>Mechs</li>
            <li>Gore/heavy body horror</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Important information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Upon submitting your commission through the form in the "Commission Me" page, I will get back to you by email as soon as I can to confirm the details, then I will start the drawing.</li>
            <li>I will ask for reference images and additional information when I contact you by email, so no need to send them when you submit the form!</li>
            <li>If you're in Canada, payment will be done through eTransfer. Otherwise, payment is done through PayPal. I will send you the sketch before payment, and will continue drawing once full payment has been received.</li>
            <li>You may cancel the commission at any time before the payment described above. It may not be possible to cancel after that.</li>
            <li>The estimated delivery time on the form is just a rough estimate. I have often gotten commissions done much faster than that, but I could also take longer.</li>
            <li>While it is very unlikely to happen, if you chose express delivery and I fail to get the commission to you within the timeframe I give, I will refund the amount you paid extra for faster delivery.</li>
            <li>I will require reference pictures of the pet you want a portrait of - the more pictures, the better!</li>
            <li>I have the right to refuse any commission if I am uncomfortable or unable to draw it for any reason.</li>
        </ul>
